title: Decision log
description: "The dated history of architectural calls: reversals, settled open questions, and where the build currently diverges from the present-tense design."
---

The architecture pages are written in the present tense as the **target design**, and each carries a
status badge that says how much of it is built ([implementation status](/architecture/status/)). Neither
axis carries **history**: why a call was made, when it was reversed, or why the shipped code differs from
the page that describes it. That is what this log is for.

A page tells you what the design **is** and how much is built. This log tells you how it **got there**:
the decisions that bind the design, the ones that were reversed in the open, and the points where the
implementation has deliberately (or accidentally) drifted from the prose. It is the project's
architecture decision record (ADR), kept lightweight and append-only.

## How it works

- **One entry per decision** that reverses a prior call, settles an [open question](/architecture/status/),
  or records a point where the build diverges from a page's present-tense design.
- Each entry carries a **date**, a **status** (`Proposed`, `Accepted`, or `Superseded`), the **decision**
  in one line, the **context** that forced it, and the **page(s)** it touches.
- A **divergence** entry is the partner of a page's inline note: the page says what is true *now*, this
  log says *why* and *when* it diverged, and which issue tracks closing the gap.
- Entries are **never edited away**. A reversed decision is marked `Superseded` and points at the entry
  that replaced it, so the trail of reasoning survives. Nothing in this log is deleted when a page
  changes.
- New reversals and divergences are added **per slice**, as part of the
  [ship gate](/contributing/slice-workflow/): if a slice changes a settled call or ships something that
  differs from its architecture page, the entry lands in the same PR.

This log was seeded on 2026-06-30 from the first architecture-drift review, which backfilled the entries
below from the project's history. From here it grows one slice at a time.

## Entries

### ADR-0001: AI acts as a user; the `agent` principal is deferred

- **Date:** 2026-06-27 | **Status:** Accepted | **Pages:** [identity and access](/architecture/identity-access/), [AI](/architecture/ai/)
- **Decision:** An AI tool authenticates over OAuth as an ordinary `human` or `service` principal and acts
  with exactly that principal's grants. A dedicated first-class `agent` principal kind is **not** in the
  initial architecture.
- **Context:** A separate `agent` identity would need its own authN, its own grant semantics, and its own
  audit treatment before any AI surface exists to use it. Treating AI as a scoped, audited user reuses the
  whole identity machinery and keeps the audit trail honest (the acting principal is the human or service).
- **Note:** The schema's `principal.kind` CHECK already **reserves** the `agent` value so a later slice
  adds the kind without editing the applied auth migration; no `agent` identity is issued today. If and
  when a first-class agent identity is built, that is a new entry that supersedes this one.

### ADR-0002: Roles carry requirements, not an allow-list

- **Date:** 2026-06-27 | **Status:** Accepted | **Pages:** [identity and access](/architecture/identity-access/)
- **Decision:** Authorization is built from additive `(role x scope)` grants, where a role is a capability
  set of `<resource>:<action>` permissions. An earlier sketch attached a per-principal **allow-list** of
  permitted actions directly.
- **Context:** A per-principal allow-list does not compose: the same operator role at two scopes, or a role
  inherited and extended, would be re-listed by hand per principal. Roles plus scope make the common case
  (the same role at different places) a single reused definition, and keep permissions additive and
  positive (no negative entries). It is also what makes the per-grant binding (an action and its scope bind
  in the *same* grant) expressible.

### ADR-0003: Health reads `ok`, not `up`

- **Date:** 2026-06-27 | **Status:** Accepted | **Pages:** [health](/architecture/health/)
- **Decision:** The healthy state of a component or system is named **`ok`**. An earlier draft used `up`.
- **Context:** `up` reads as reachability (the device answers), which is only one input to health. Health is
  a rollup verdict ("is this system working?") that can be unhealthy while every device is reachable, or
  healthy while a redundant member is down. `ok` names the verdict rather than the ping, so the word does
  not promise something narrower than the model delivers.

### ADR-0004: Credentials ship bearer-only

- **Date:** 2026-06-27 | **Status:** Resolved (identity slices 1-2) | **Pages:** [identity and access](/architecture/identity-access/)
- **Resolved:** Password credentials shipped in identity slice 1 ([#35](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/pull/35)) and slice 2 ([#70](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/pull/70)): `credential.kind` now allows `bearer` or `password` (argon2id, PHC-encoded, one password per principal), and a human signs in with a username and password behind an httpOnly session cookie. The `oidc` / `nats` methods and the full `(method, identifier)` lookup key remain deferred (future slices).
- **Decision (divergence):** The shipped `credential` table carries `kind = 'bearer'` only, stored as the
  token's sha256 with a non-secret `ogp_` locator prefix. The design's fuller model (the `password`,
  `oidc`, and `nats` methods, and the `(method, identifier)` lookup key) is **deferred**, not yet built.
- **Context:** The auth foundation slice needed exactly one working authN method to prove the capability and
  scope seams end to end. Bearer tokens are the thinnest honest cut: a service credential the bootstrap and
  the CLI can both carry. Password login is the first slice of the [identity tier epic (#27)](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/27)
  ([slice #28](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/28)), which adds `password` to the
  `credential.kind` CHECK in a new migration (never editing the applied one). OIDC and the NATS node
  credential follow with their own surfaces.
- **Closes the gap:** epic [#27](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/27).

### ADR-0005: The first owner is `omniglass bootstrap`

- **Date:** 2026-06-27 | **Status:** Resolved (identity slice 1) | **Pages:** [identity and access](/architecture/identity-access/)
- **Resolved:** `omniglass bootstrap <username> --password <pw>` shipped in identity slice 1 ([#35](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/pull/35)): bootstrap now installs a password credential on create (plus `--email` / `--display-name`), so the owner can sign in to the console without a separate step. The `og iam` admin command namespace is still deferred (it lands with the admin user surface, slice 3).
- **Decision (divergence):** The first owner is created by `omniglass bootstrap <username>`, which mints an
  `owner@all` grant plus a **bearer** credential in one transaction. The design page describes the eventual
  `og iam create-owner --username ... --email ...` password path under an `iam` command namespace; that
  namespace and the password credential are **deferred**.
- **Context:** Bootstrap has to work before any login surface exists, so it pairs with the bearer-only
  credential decision (ADR-0004): one trusted, idempotent command that produces a token the operator pastes
  into the console or CLI. The `iam` command family (and the password-on-create path) lands with the
  identity-tier admin surfaces.
- **Closes the gap:** epic [#27](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/27).

### ADR-0006: The owner invariant is enforced by bootstrap for now

- **Date:** 2026-06-27 | **Status:** Resolved (identity slice 3c) | **Pages:** [identity and access](/architecture/identity-access/)
- **Resolved:** The `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED` constraint trigger (`principal_grant_owner_guard`) shipped with grant revocation ([issue #82](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/82)): it refuses to leave zero `owner @ all` grants at `COMMIT`, so revoking the last owner is a clean 409 while a swap (grant a new owner + revoke the old in one transaction) still passes. The gateway maps its custom SQLSTATE `OG001` to `ErrLastOwner`.
- **Decision (divergence):** "At least one active `owner@all` grant exists at all times" is upheld today by
  the bootstrap path (it always creates one) and the absence of any grant-revocation surface. The design's
  **deferrable Postgres constraint trigger** that enforces it at `COMMIT` (so the swap-owners-in-one-txn
  pattern works) is **not yet built**.
- **Context:** With no API to revoke a grant or delete a principal, the last-owner removal the trigger
  guards against is not yet reachable, so the trigger is not load-bearing until grant CRUD ships. It is
  required before the admin user-management slice exposes grant revocation
  ([epic #27](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/27), slice 3).
- **Closes the gap:** epic [#27](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/27).

### ADR-0007: Principals are gated at all-scope, not scope-tree

- **Date:** 2026-07-01 | **Status:** Accepted | **Pages:** [identity and access](/architecture/identity-access/)
- **Decision:** A `principal` is not a scope-tree entity: it is not "under" a location, system, or component,
  so the `principal:<action>` capability confers access **only at all-scope**. A grant scoped to a location
  or system carries no principal access, and the Storage Gateway refuses a non-all scope on the principal
  directory with a 403 (`ErrPrincipalForbidden`) rather than silently returning an empty list. This falls out
  of the scope resolver: `applicableKinds("principal")` is empty, so only an `all` grant resolves to a
  non-empty set.
- **Context:** The admin principal directory (slice 3a, [issue #77](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/77))
  is the first surface to gate on `principal:*`. Modelling users as scope-tree entities would be wrong (there
  is no "users under HQ"), and returning an empty list to a mis-scoped admin would hide a misconfiguration, so
  making all-scope explicit keeps the capability honest and surfaces the error. The same rule governs the later
  principal-mutation and grant surfaces.
- **Closes the gap:** n/a (a design decision, not a divergence).

### ADR-0008: Disable is hard revocation; no token-version column

- **Date:** 2026-07-06 | **Status:** Accepted | **Pages:** [identity and access](/architecture/identity-access/)
- **Decision:** Disabling a principal revokes its live sessions immediately, achieved by the authn path
  re-reading `principal.active` on **every** request, not by a session-version / epoch column.
  `AuthenticateBearer` and `AuthenticatePassword` both filter `and pr.active` in the credential lookup on
  every call, with no caching anywhere in the authn path, so the very next request on an already-issued
  bearer or session cookie after a disable gets zero rows and a 401. `SetPrincipalActive` flips the flag in
  one statement: disable **is** revocation, atomically. No `token_version` column is added.
- **Context:** Issue [#94](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/94) asked for "hard session
  revocation on disable", assuming disable was soft (a propagation delay). It is not: the per-request active
  check already is the hard-revocation mechanism, proven end to end by `TestDisableRevokesLiveSessionAPI` (a
  live token is 401 on its next request the moment it is disabled) and `TestDisablePrincipal`. A
  `token_version` column would matter only as an invalidation signal for an authn-result cache, which does
  not exist; adding it now would be a dead column with no reader, against the primitive-first and
  meaningful-migration disciplines. Revisit if any cache/memoization is introduced in the authn path (an
  epoch bump would then be its invalidation signal).
- **Closes the gap:** issue [#94](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/94), closed as already satisfied.
