title: Decision log
description: "The dated history of architectural calls: reversals, settled open questions, and where the build currently diverges from the present-tense design."
---

The architecture pages are written in the present tense as the **target design**, and each carries a
status badge that says how much of it is built ([implementation status](/architecture/status/)). Neither
axis carries **history**: why a call was made, when it was reversed, or why the shipped code differs from
the page that describes it. That is what this log is for.

A page tells you what the design **is** and how much is built. This log tells you how it **got there**:
the decisions that bind the design, the ones that were reversed in the open, and the points where the
implementation has deliberately (or accidentally) drifted from the prose. It is the project's
architecture decision record (ADR), kept lightweight and append-only.

## How it works

- **One entry per decision** that reverses a prior call, settles an [open question](/architecture/status/),
  or records a point where the build diverges from a page's present-tense design.
- Each entry carries a **date**, a **status** (`Proposed`, `Accepted`, or `Superseded`), the **decision**
  in one line, the **context** that forced it, and the **page(s)** it touches.
- A **divergence** entry is the partner of a page's inline note: the page says what is true *now*, this
  log says *why* and *when* it diverged, and which issue tracks closing the gap.
- Entries are **never edited away**. A reversed decision is marked `Superseded` and points at the entry
  that replaced it, so the trail of reasoning survives. Nothing in this log is deleted when a page
  changes.
- New reversals and divergences are added **per slice**, as part of the
  [ship gate](/contributing/slice-workflow/): if a slice changes a settled call or ships something that
  differs from its architecture page, the entry lands in the same PR.

This log was seeded on 2026-06-30 from the first architecture-drift review, which backfilled the entries
below from the project's history. From here it grows one slice at a time.

## Entries

### ADR-0001: AI acts as a user; the `agent` principal is deferred

- **Date:** 2026-06-27 | **Status:** Accepted | **Pages:** [identity and access](/architecture/identity-access/), [AI](/architecture/ai/)
- **Decision:** An AI tool authenticates over OAuth as an ordinary `human` or `service` principal and acts
  with exactly that principal's grants. A dedicated first-class `agent` principal kind is **not** in the
  initial architecture.
- **Context:** A separate `agent` identity would need its own authN, its own grant semantics, and its own
  audit treatment before any AI surface exists to use it. Treating AI as a scoped, audited user reuses the
  whole identity machinery and keeps the audit trail honest (the acting principal is the human or service).
- **Note:** The schema's `principal.kind` CHECK already **reserves** the `agent` value so a later slice
  adds the kind without editing the applied auth migration; no `agent` identity is issued today. If and
  when a first-class agent identity is built, that is a new entry that supersedes this one.

### ADR-0002: Roles carry requirements, not an allow-list

- **Date:** 2026-06-27 | **Status:** Accepted | **Pages:** [identity and access](/architecture/identity-access/)
- **Decision:** Authorization is built from additive `(role x scope)` grants, where a role is a capability
  set of `<resource>:<action>` permissions. An earlier sketch attached a per-principal **allow-list** of
  permitted actions directly.
- **Context:** A per-principal allow-list does not compose: the same operator role at two scopes, or a role
  inherited and extended, would be re-listed by hand per principal. Roles plus scope make the common case
  (the same role at different places) a single reused definition, and keep permissions additive and
  positive (no negative entries). It is also what makes the per-grant binding (an action and its scope bind
  in the *same* grant) expressible.

### ADR-0003: Health reads `ok`, not `up`

- **Date:** 2026-06-27 | **Status:** Accepted | **Pages:** [health](/architecture/health/)
- **Decision:** The healthy state of a component or system is named **`ok`**. An earlier draft used `up`.
- **Context:** `up` reads as reachability (the device answers), which is only one input to health. Health is
  a rollup verdict ("is this system working?") that can be unhealthy while every device is reachable, or
  healthy while a redundant member is down. `ok` names the verdict rather than the ping, so the word does
  not promise something narrower than the model delivers.

### ADR-0004: Credentials ship bearer-only

- **Date:** 2026-06-27 | **Status:** Accepted | **Pages:** [identity and access](/architecture/identity-access/)
- **Decision (divergence):** The shipped `credential` table carries `kind = 'bearer'` only, stored as the
  token's sha256 with a non-secret `ogp_` locator prefix. The design's fuller model (the `password`,
  `oidc`, and `nats` methods, and the `(method, identifier)` lookup key) is **deferred**, not yet built.
- **Context:** The auth foundation slice needed exactly one working authN method to prove the capability and
  scope seams end to end. Bearer tokens are the thinnest honest cut: a service credential the bootstrap and
  the CLI can both carry. Password login is the first slice of the [identity tier epic (#27)](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/27)
  ([slice #28](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/28)), which adds `password` to the
  `credential.kind` CHECK in a new migration (never editing the applied one). OIDC and the NATS node
  credential follow with their own surfaces.
- **Closes the gap:** epic [#27](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/27).

### ADR-0005: The first owner is `omniglass bootstrap`

- **Date:** 2026-06-27 | **Status:** Accepted | **Pages:** [identity and access](/architecture/identity-access/)
- **Decision (divergence):** The first owner is created by `omniglass bootstrap <username>`, which mints an
  `owner@all` grant plus a **bearer** credential in one transaction. The design page describes the eventual
  `og iam create-owner --username ... --email ...` password path under an `iam` command namespace; that
  namespace and the password credential are **deferred**.
- **Context:** Bootstrap has to work before any login surface exists, so it pairs with the bearer-only
  credential decision (ADR-0004): one trusted, idempotent command that produces a token the operator pastes
  into the console or CLI. The `iam` command family (and the password-on-create path) lands with the
  identity-tier admin surfaces.
- **Closes the gap:** epic [#27](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/27).

### ADR-0006: The owner invariant is enforced by bootstrap for now

- **Date:** 2026-06-27 | **Status:** Accepted | **Pages:** [identity and access](/architecture/identity-access/)
- **Decision (divergence):** "At least one active `owner@all` grant exists at all times" is upheld today by
  the bootstrap path (it always creates one) and the absence of any grant-revocation surface. The design's
  **deferrable Postgres constraint trigger** that enforces it at `COMMIT` (so the swap-owners-in-one-txn
  pattern works) is **not yet built**.
- **Context:** With no API to revoke a grant or delete a principal, the last-owner removal the trigger
  guards against is not yet reachable, so the trigger is not load-bearing until grant CRUD ships. It is
  required before the admin user-management slice exposes grant revocation
  ([epic #27](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/27), slice 3).
- **Closes the gap:** epic [#27](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/27).
