title: "Labels"
description: "The fixed label taxonomy: what is a native Issue Type, what is a Project field, and what stays a label."

Labels are a small, fixed set. Two whole categories that would otherwise be labels
are not labels here: they live in first-class GitHub fields instead, and labels are
reserved for the axes those fields do not cover.

## What is not a label

- **Kind of work** is a native **Issue Type** (`Task`, `Bug`, `Feature`, `Epic`), set on
  the issue itself, never a `type:*` label. It maps to the conventional-commit type the
  eventual PR carries: `Task` = ci/docs/chore/refactor/test/perf, `Bug` = fix,
  `Feature` = feat, `Epic` groups a body of work. One field, filterable, with no parallel
  label to drift out of sync.
- **Priority** is a single-select **field on the Omniglass Project board**
  (`High`/`Medium`/`Low`), never a `prio:*` label. It sorts and groups on the board, where
  planning actually happens.

Using a label for either would duplicate a field GitHub already models, and two systems
for one fact drift apart.

## What is a label

Everything left is one of two prefixed families. The prefix encodes the one distinction
that matters: does the label **describe** the issue, or does it **trigger** automation?

### `area:<subsystem>` describes

The subsystem a change touches, matching the architecture glossary:

`area:foundation` `area:api` `area:storage` `area:auth` `area:collection` `area:expr`
`area:ui` `area:node`

Purely descriptive: it filters the issue list by subsystem. An issue can carry more than
one.

### `run:<task>` triggers

A label that makes CI *do something* when it is applied. The `run:` prefix is a two-way
promise: if a label runs automation it is named `run:<task>`, and if a label is named
`run:<task>` then applying it runs that task.

| Label | Applying it | Wired |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run:preview` | spins up a live [PR preview environment](/guides/pr-previews/); removing it tears the preview down | yes |
| `run:build` | rebuilds the release binaries and container image for the PR head on demand | reserved |
| `run:test` | runs the full test suite on demand | reserved |

`run:preview` is live today (the [PR previews guide](/guides/pr-previews/) covers it, and
`preview-comment.yml` is the workflow behind it). The reserved names hold the namespace for
workflows that do not exist yet; wire the workflow in the same PR that first relies on the
label, rather than leaving a label that silently does nothing.

## The fixed set

That is the whole taxonomy: a native Issue Type, the Project priority field, `area:*`, and
`run:*`. There are no stock GitHub labels (`bug`, `enhancement`, `good first issue` and the
rest were removed) and no bare `type:*` or `prio:*` labels. Adding a label means either a
new subsystem (`area:*`) or a new automation task (`run:*`); anything else belongs in a
field.
