title: "The first owner is `omniglass bootstrap`"

status: "Resolved"
summary: "`omniglass bootstrap <username> [--password]`; the password-on-create path shipped, the `iam` namespace is deferred"

- **Date:** 2026-06-27 | **Status:** Resolved (identity slice 1) | **Pages:** [identity and access](/architecture/identity-access/)
- **Resolved:** `omniglass bootstrap <username> --password <pw>` shipped in identity slice 1 ([#35](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/pull/35)): bootstrap now installs a password credential on create (plus `--email` / `--display-name`), so the owner can sign in to the console without a separate step. The `og iam` admin command namespace is still deferred (it lands with the admin user surface, slice 3).
- **Decision (divergence):** The first owner is created by `omniglass bootstrap <username>`, which mints an
  `owner@all` grant plus a **bearer** credential in one transaction. The design page describes the eventual
  `og iam create-owner --username ... --email ...` password path under an `iam` command namespace; that
  namespace and the password credential are **deferred**.
- **Context:** Bootstrap has to work before any login surface exists, so it pairs with the bearer-only
  credential decision (ADR-0004): one trusted, idempotent command that produces a token the operator pastes
  into the console or CLI. The `iam` command family (and the password-on-create path) lands with the
  identity-tier admin surfaces.
- **Closes the gap:** epic [#27](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/27).
