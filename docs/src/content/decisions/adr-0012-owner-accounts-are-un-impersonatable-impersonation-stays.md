summary: "Owner accounts are un-impersonatable by anyone; impersonate stays swept by `principal:*`; drop act-as scope intersection (#101)"

- **Date:** 2026-07-07 | **Status:** Accepted | **Pages:** [identity and access](/architecture/identity-access/)
- **Decision:** Harden the impersonation authorization model on tiers, not scope. (1) A principal holding
  `owner @ all` cannot be impersonated by **anyone**, including another owner, in either mode (issue
  [#106](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/106)): a target-side check in the `:impersonate`
  handler, before the mode branch. (2) The `principal:impersonate` capability stays **swept by the
  `principal:*` wildcard** (admin) and `*:*` (owner); it is not carved out as a sensitive action, because
  holding `principal:*` already lets a caller create and use its own principals, so impersonate confers no new
  reach there. (3) **Drop** act-as scope intersection ([#101](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/101)):
  act-as stays all-scope-only.
- **Context:** The escalation guard (`Covers`) already blocks a lesser admin from impersonating an owner, but
  `owner.Covers(owner)` is true, so owner-impersonates-owner was possible. An owner is the highest-trust
  account and impersonating one is a full-takeover vector, so the explicit owner-protection rule removes it
  entirely and reads more clearly than relying on cover arithmetic. Owner detection reuses the same
  `role='owner' and scope_kind='all'` lane as the [owner invariant](#the-owner-invariant), so it is not new
  role-name branching. Scope intersection (a scoped admin acting-as within its own subtree by intersecting two
  scope Sets per row) was dropped as complexity for a narrow case; the tier model plus all-scope-only act-as is
  simpler and safe. The impersonated-vs-direct distinction an operator needs in the audit trail is already
  recorded by `audit_log.real_actor_principal_id` ([ADR-0010](#adr-0010-impersonation-is-a-session-not-a-credential-guarded-by-capability-cover));
  surfacing it is a later auth-event audit slice.
- **Refines:** [ADR-0010](#adr-0010-impersonation-is-a-session-not-a-credential-guarded-by-capability-cover).
- **Closes the gap:** issue [#106](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/106); closes [#101](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/101) as dropped.
