title: "Disable is hard revocation; no token-version column"

status: "Accepted"
summary: "Disable revokes live sessions via the per-request `active` re-read; no token-version column (nothing consumes it)"
---

- **Date:** 2026-07-06 | **Status:** Accepted | **Pages:** [identity and access](/architecture/identity-access/)
- **Decision:** Disabling a principal revokes its live sessions immediately, achieved by the authn path
  re-reading `principal.active` on **every** request, not by a session-version / epoch column.
  `AuthenticateBearer` and `AuthenticatePassword` both filter `and pr.active` in the credential lookup on
  every call, with no caching anywhere in the authn path, so the very next request on an already-issued
  bearer or session cookie after a disable gets zero rows and a 401. `SetPrincipalActive` flips the flag in
  one statement: disable **is** revocation, atomically. No `token_version` column is added.
- **Context:** Issue [#94](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/94) asked for "hard session
  revocation on disable", assuming disable was soft (a propagation delay). It is not: the per-request active
  check already is the hard-revocation mechanism, proven end to end by `TestDisableRevokesLiveSessionAPI` (a
  live token is 401 on its next request the moment it is disabled) and `TestDisablePrincipal`. A
  `token_version` column would matter only as an invalidation signal for an authn-result cache, which does
  not exist; adding it now would be a dead column with no reader, against the primitive-first and
  meaningful-migration disciplines. Revisit if any cache/memoization is introduced in the authn path (an
  epoch bump would then be its invalidation signal).
- **Closes the gap:** issue [#94](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/94), closed as already satisfied.
