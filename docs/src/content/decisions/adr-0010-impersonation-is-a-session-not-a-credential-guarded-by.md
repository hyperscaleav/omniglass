title: "Impersonation is a session, not a credential; guarded by capability cover"

status: "Accepted"
summary: "Impersonation ships view-as + act-as as an `impersonation_session` (not a credential), guarded by capability-cover, with a real-actor audit column"

- **Date:** 2026-07-06 | **Status:** Accepted | **Pages:** [identity and access](/architecture/identity-access/)
- **Decision:** Admin/owner impersonation ships with **both** modes (view-as read-only, act-as full) in one
  slice. An impersonation token is an `impersonation_session` row (its own table: target, real actor, mode,
  expiry, revoke), **not** a `credential` (which authenticates a principal as itself). Authorization to
  impersonate is the escalation guard `actor.Covers(target)` (the caller's capabilities must cover the
  target's) plus the `principal:impersonate` capability at all-scope. Capability cover applies to both modes;
  **scope** is where the modes diverge: **view-as** is cross-scope (read-only grants no write authority, and
  seeing another scope is the troubleshooting case), but **act-as** additionally requires the caller's
  **all-scope grants alone** to cover the target: a capability held only through a narrower grant does not
  count. Without that, act-as would let a split-grant admin (all-scope user management, but infra scoped to
  campus X) impersonate a campus-Y admin and gain write in Y, since an impersonated request resolves its ABAC
  scope from the target: a scope escalation. Because the rule is capability-cover against the caller's
  all-scope grants (not a hardcoded list of scoped resources), it closes non-tree escalation too: a user-admin
  who holds grant authority only through a scoped grant (empty effective scope, cannot create a grant directly)
  cannot launder all-scope grant authority by acting-as a grant admin. Accountability
  is a nullable `audit_log.real_actor_principal_id` written on the row directly, not reconstructed from a
  time-window join (clock skew and concurrent sessions make that unreliable for an accountability record), and
  the self-service mutations (`/auth/me` profile and password) audit too so an act-as edit is never untracked.
- **Context:** view-as is enforced by refusing every non-read action when the request carries a view-as
  claim; act-as threads the real actor through the audit writer via a request-scoped context value
  (`storage.WithRealActor`), so no mutating gateway signature changes. `authn` tries the impersonation session
  on a bearer-hash miss, so the same `Authorization: Bearer` path serves both. Disabling either party kills
  the session via the per-request `active` re-read ([ADR-0008](#adr-0008-disable-is-hard-revocation-no-token-version-column)).
  The console ships an Impersonate action (view-as / act-as) and an acting-as banner. Deferred: re-checking
  the escalation guard on every request (bounded instead by a short TTL plus revoke), and act-as within a
  scoped admin's own scope by intersecting the target's scope with the caller's ([#101](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/101)),
  rather than the current all-scope-only act-as rule.
- **Closes the gap:** issue [#85](https://github.com/hyperscaleav/omniglass/issues/85).
